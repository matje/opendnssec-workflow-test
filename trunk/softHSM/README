INTRODUCTION

The DNSSEC Signer, part of the OpenDNSSEC project, handles and stores its 
cryptographic keys via the PKCS#11 interface. This interface specifies how 
to communicate with cryptographic devices such as HSM:s (Hardware Security 
Modules) and smart cards. The purpose of these devices is, among others, 
to generate cryptographic keys and sign information without revealing 
private-key material to the outside world. They are often designed to 
perform well on these specific tasks compared to ordinary processes in a 
normal computer.

A potential problem with the use of the PKCS#11 interface is that it might 
limit the wide spread use of the DNSSEC Signer, since a potential user 
might not be willing to invest in a new hardware device. To counter this 
effect, OpenDNSSEC is providing a software implementation of a generic 
cryptographic device with a PKCS#11 interface, the SoftHSM. SoftHSM is 
designed to meet the requirements of the DNSSEC Signer, but can also work 
together with other cryptographic products because of the PKCS#11 
interface.

DEPENDENCIES

SoftHSM depends on the Botan 1.8.0 or greater (a cryptographic library) 
and SQLite 3.4.2 or greater (a database library). They can be found at:
  http://botan.randombit.net
and
  http://www.sqlite.org

INSTALLING

1. Create the installation/compilation scripts.

  chmod 744 autogen.sh
  ./autogen.sh

2. Configure the installation/compilation scripts.

  ./configure

  Options:

    --with-botan-lib=DIR    The location of the Botan crypto library 
                            (default DIR=/usr/local/lib)
    --with-botan-inc=DIR    The location of the Botan crypto library 
                            include files (default DIR=/usr/local/include)
    --with-sqlite3-lib=DIR  The location of the SQLite3 library 
                            (default DIR=/usr/lib)
    --with-sqlite3-inc=DIR  The location of the SQLite3 library include 
                            files (default DIR=/usr/include)
    --enable-64bit          Compile a 64-bit version

  For more options:

  ./configure --help

3. Compile the source code.

  make

4. Install the library

  sudo make install
