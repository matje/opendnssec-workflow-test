.SH NAME
softhsm-keyconv \- converting between BIND and PKCS#8 key file formats.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B softhsm-keyconv 
[OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBsofthsm-keyconv\fR can convert between BIND .private-key files and the PKCS#8 file format.
This is so that you can import the PKCS#8 file into libsofthsm using the command \fBsofthsm\fR.
If you have another file format, then \fBopenssl\fR probably can help you to convert it into
the PKCS#8 file format.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.TP
\fB--topkcs8\fR
Convert from BIND .private-key format to PKCS#8.
Use with \fB--in\fR, \fB--out\fR, and \fB--pin\fR.

.TP
\fB--tobind\fR
Convert from PKCS#8 to BIND .private-key format.
Use with \fB--in\fR, \fB--pin\fR, \fB--name\fR, \fB--ttl\fR, \fB--ksk\fR, and \fB--algorithm\fR.

.TP
\fB--tobind\fR
Convert from PKCS#8 to BIND .private-key format.
Use with \fB--in\fR, \fB--pin\fR, \fB--name\fR, \fB--ttl\fR, \fB--ksk\fR, and \fB--algorithm\fR.

.TP
\fB--algorithm \fI<algorithm>\fR
Specifies which DNSSEC algorithm to use in file.
RSAMD5
DSA
RSASHA1
RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1
DSA-NSEC3-SHA1
RSASHA256
RSASHA512

.TP
\fB--help, -h\fR
Show the help screen.

.TP
\fB--in \fI<path>\fR
The path to the input file.

.TP
\fB--ksk\fR
This will set the flag field to 257 instead of 256 in the DNSKEY RR in the .key file. Indicating that the key is a Key Signing Key. Can be used when 
converting to BIND format.

.TP
\fB--name \fI<name>\fR
The owner name. Do not forget the trailing dot, e.g. "example.com."

.TP
\fB--out \fI<path>\fR
The path to the output file.

.TP
\fB--pin \fI<PIN>\fR
To encrypt/decrypt PKCS#8 file. Optional.

.TP
\fB--ttl \fI<ttl>\fR
The TTL to use for the DNSKEY RR. Optional, will default to 3600 seconds.
