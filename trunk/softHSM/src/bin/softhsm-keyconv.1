.SH NAME
softhsm-keyconv \- converting between BIND and PKCS#8 key file formats.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B softhsm-keyconv --topkcs8
\fB--in \fIpath\fR \fB--out \fIpath\fR [\fB--pin \fIPIN\fR]
.br
.B softhsm-keyconv --tobind
\fB--in \fIpath\fR [\fB--pin \fIPIN\fR] \fB--name \fIname\fR [\fB--ttl \fIttl\fR \fB--ksk\fR] \fB--algorithm \fIalgorithm\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBsofthsm-keyconv\fR can convert between BIND .private-key files and the PKCS#8 file format.
This is so that you can import the PKCS#8 file into libsofthsm using the command \fBsofthsm\fR.
If you have another file format, then \fBopenssl\fR probably can help you to convert it into the PKCS#8 file format.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.TP
\fB--topkcs8\fR
Convert from BIND .private-key format to PKCS#8.
.br
Use with \fB--in\fR, \fB--out\fR, and \fB--pin\fR.

.TP
\fB--tobind\fR
Convert from PKCS#8 to BIND .private-key format.
.br
Use with \fB--in\fR, \fB--pin\fR, \fB--name\fR, \fB--ttl\fR, \fB--ksk\fR, and \fB--algorithm\fR.

.TP
\fB--algorithm \fIalgorithm\fR
Specifies which DNSSEC \fIalgorithm\fR to use when converting to BIND format.

The supported algorithms are:
    RSAMD5
    DSA
    RSASHA1
    RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1
    DSA-NSEC3-SHA1
    RSASHA256
    RSASHA512

.TP
\fB--help, -h\fR
Show the help screen.

.TP
\fB--in \fIpath\fR
The \fIpath\fR to the input file.

.TP
\fB--ksk\fR
This will set the flag field to 257 instead of 256 in the DNSKEY RR in the .key file.
Indicating that the key is a Key Signing Key. Can be used when converting to BIND format.

.TP
\fB--name \fIname\fR
The owner \fIname\fR to use in the BIND file name and in the DNSKEY RR.
Do not forget the trailing dot, e.g. "example.com."

.TP
\fB--out \fIpath\fR
The \fIpath\fR to the output file.

.TP
\fB--pin \fIPIN\fR
The \fIPIN\fR will be used to encrypt or decrypt the PKCS#8 file depending if we are converting to or from PKCS#8.
If not given then the PKCS#8 file is assumed to be unencrypted.

.TP
\fB--ttl \fITTL\fR
The \fITTL\fR to use for the DNSKEY RR. Optional, will default to 3600 seconds.

.SH BIND KEY FILES

The following files will be created when converting to BIND file format:
.TP
K\fIname\fR+\fIalg_id\fR+\fIkey_tag\fR.key
Public key in RR format
.TP
K\fIname\fR+\fIalg_id\fR+\fIkey_tag\fR.private
Private key in BIND key format

.TP
The three parts of the file name means the following:
.TP
    \fIname\fR
The owner name given by the \fB--name\fR argument.
.TP
    \fIalg_id\fR
A numeric representation of the \fB--algorithm\fR argument.
.TP
    \fIkey_tag\fR
Is a checksum of the DNSKEY RDATA.

.SH EXAMPLES

To convert a BIND .private-key file to a PKCS#8 file, the following command can be used:

    softhsm-keyconv --in Kexample.com.+007+05474.private --out rsa.pem

To convert a PKCS#8 file to BIND key files, the following command can be used:

    softhsm-keyconv --in rsa.pem --name example.com. --ksk --algorithm RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1
