This program will check all the PKCS#11 functions implemented by SoftHSM.
It test many combinations of input data and checks that the correct
responses are returned.

The test program assumes that:

  slot 0 has no token
  slot 1 has a token with the PINs:
    user PIN = 123456
    SO PIN = 12345678
  slot 9999 does not exist

This program is only available in the repository and not in the distribution.
