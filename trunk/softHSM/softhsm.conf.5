.SH NAME
softhsm.conf \- SoftHSM configuration file

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B softhsm.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION

In PKCS#11 you need tokens in order to do cryptographic operations.
Tokens can be viewed as object stores where you can store e.g. private
and public keys. A token must then be attached to a slot so that you
can use it.

Slots and tokens are handled by the SoftHSM configuration file. The file
is by default located in the system configuration directory. But 
this location can be change by setting the environment variable. If this
variable is present, then SoftHSM will use that path instead of the
default one.

    export SOFTHSM_CONF=/home/user/config.file

The given paths in the configuration file are just an indication to 
SoftHSM on where it should store the information for each token. The token
databases will be created when the tokens gets initialized.

.SH FILE FORMAT

Each pair of slot and token are configured on one line. Starting with an unsigned
integer as the slot ID and the a path where SoftHSM can create a SQLite database.
These parameters are separated by a semicolon. It is ok to have extra space between
the parameters, since these will be ignored.

    \fI<Slot_ID>\fR:\fI<Path_to_the_token_database>\fR

It is also possible to add comments in the file by using the hash sign. Anything
after the hash sign will be ignored.

    #\fI<text>\fR

Any line that does not have the correct format will be ignored.

.SH EXAMPLE

    # A comment
    0:/var/softhsm/slot0.db

    1: /home/user/token.database # My own token
