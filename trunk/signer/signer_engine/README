This is a proof-of-concept of the signer engine for OpenDNSSEC;
a python-based 'engine' that keeps track of signing intervals and
resigns the zones.

there is not much in the form of error checking yet, and if something
goes wrong, it will mangle the signed zone files. 

It might very well not work at all ;)

to run it you must have a compiled version of ldns trunk in your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH on OSX), and (re)compiled
the trunk version of the signer tools, as well as the softHSM library.

Paths it uses are relative, so the test_engine script will only work if
it is run from its own directory (<repos>/signer_engine/test).

To run the test engine:
cd <repos>/signer_engine/test
./test_engine

If you stop it, and restart it again, it should recognize whether the
test zone needs resigning based upon the last-modified time of the
output file.
