The signer engine and its tools are part of the OpenDNSSEC project.

INTRODUCTION

As part of the OpenDNSSEC project, the task of the signer engine is to
schedule signing operation on DNS zones. Taking input from the KASP, it
will automatically sign zones and keep their signatures up-to-date.

In this version, it can only do file-to-file signing, and not use AXFR
or IXFR. When a zone has changed, the engine can run a specified
command, for instance to signal an actual DNS server that it should
reload its zones.

The current signer engine consists of two parts; The actual scheduler
and a set of tools to do zone manipulation.

The scheduler is written in Python and is run as a daemon. When a zone
needs to be sorted or (re)signed, it will call the necessary tools,
which are written in C, to do the actual work. It uses a
worker/task-queue design, where the worker threads will suspend
until there is something to do. 

DEPENDENCIES

The C-based tools depend on the ldns library
http://www.NLnetLabs.nl/projects/ldns
and can only be used in conjuction with a PKCS#11 library (a software
version of which, softHSM, is supplied with the OpenDNSSEC).

The python part of the engine depends on the 4suite implementation of
xml (the package name for Ubuntu is python-4suite-xml).


INSTALLATION

To build and install the signer engine, the following steps are needed:

From the base directory <opendnssec>/signer

autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make install

This will build the C-based tools, and set up the tools and engine to
use the options provided with configure:

--with-ldns=<dir> The base directory (prefix) of your ldns installation,
                  if it isn't in your standard path.
--prefix=<dir>    Installation directory. All files will be installed
                  relative to this path, and default search paths will
                  be relative to the prefix. Defaults to /usr/local


The tools, and the main engine invocation script, will be installed in
<prefix>/bin
The python libraries will be installed in
<prefix>/lib/python/signer_engine/
