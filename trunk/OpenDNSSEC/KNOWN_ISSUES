OpenDNSSEC 1.4.0a1 - Known Restrictions

The following are the known problems and/or restrictions of release 1.4.0a1 of
OpenDNSSEC.


Limitations on Number of Zones
------------------------------

Owing to contention in the key management database, performance is degraded if
OpenDNSSEC is used to sign large numbers of zones that do not share common
keys. The problem is worse if SQLite is used for the key and signature manager
database.

As a workaround, we suggest that either the same key is used for all zones, or
that the number of zones be limited to about 5,000.

This will be addressed in a future release of the software.


Incompatibility in TSIG Key
---------------------------

When setting up a TSIG key for the zone fetcher component, it should be noted
that the SHA algorithm family used by OpenDNSSEC is incompatible with the
BIND-9, due to a problem in the latter's cryptographic library.

The problem is fixed in the upcoming BIND-9.7 release; in the meantime, avoid
using TSIG authentication between the zone fetcher and the upstream
nameserver.


Issue with rolling from one algorithm to another
------------------------------------------------

The current version will handle key rollovers that also change algorithm just 
the same as any other key rollover. This is not sufficient; and so rolling 
between algorithms is broken and should not be done with the current system.


Handling of external command calls
----------------------------------

External commands (e.g. NotifyCommand or DelegationSignerSubmitCommand) are 
called with popen. This can lead to errors with these external scripts not
being noticed by OpenDNSSEC. It is therefore recommended that when writing
scripts like these that they log enough information for the user to tell
independently if they failed.


Maximum number of HSMs
----------------------

The datatype of the column storing HSMs in the kasp database is only large 
enough to store 127 separate HSMs (with a MySQL backend).


Quotation marks in strings
--------------------------

Enforcer does not remove/handle any quotation marks in the imported strings.
This will create a problem when importing the information from e.g. the policy
description field into the Enforcer database.


Backup files redesign
---------------------

The backup files for the signer are being redesigned for version 1.4.0. In this
first alpha release, the backup files are not read in correctly and will
be considered corrupted.
