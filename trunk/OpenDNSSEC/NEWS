OpenDNSSEC trunk

* ...

Bugfixes:
* Signer Engine: Signer processes could remain open, if they were not close 
  correctly.
* ods-ksmutil: Got a segmentation fault, when an HSM was missing in the 
  configuration. Only applied to versions using MySQL.
* Zone fetcher: Did not close files before moving them.
* Zone fetcher: The serial arithmetic was not correct.
* Auditor: It now ignores unrecognized RR types.
* Signer Engine: Wrong handling of escaped characters in strings 
  (fixed in ldns trunk)
* Set correct permissions on the configuration files.

Known issues:
* Zone fetcher: When using TSIG, an incorrect MAC can be created if the 
  length of the used secret is 'too long' (longer than the maximum digest
  length). This problem is in LDNS 1.6.3 and previous versions. This bug is
  fixed in the upcoming LDNS 1.6.4 release.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0rc1 - 2009-12-04

* Auditor: dnsruby-1.41 should be used (includes fixes for zero length
  salt and RFC3597 unknown classes)
* Signer Engine: ldns 1.6.3 should be used (includes NSEC3 bugfix and class
  inheritance when creating signatures)

Bugfixes:
* Signer Engine: 1.0.0b8 introduced a bug that no signatures where reused.
  Re-fixed.
* Signer Engine: Fix ods-signer start (could hang on MacOSX)
* Signer Engine: Mark a zone in progress if in use by one of the tools.
  Prevents multiple tasks being created for the same zone.
* Signer Engine: Dropped records when zone content changed.
* Signer Engine: Drop inherited groups and set additional groups when dropping
  privileges.
* Zone fetcher: Clean up empty files if AXFR failed
* Zone fetcher: Make syslogging RFC-compliant


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b9 - 2009-11-27

* ods-ksmutil: update command split so that individual configuration files can
  be updated separately.
* ods-ksmutil: "ds-seen" renamed to "ksk-roll" which is a more accurate 
  description of its effect. (ds-seen will reappear in v1.1)
* add contributed .spec file for RPM builds
* Signer Engine: verifies signature after creation.

Bugfixes:
* Signer Engine: Output better information if the HSM fails with the signing.
* ods-ksmutil: update zonelist correctly links keys to new zones if key sharing 
  is turned on.
* Bugreport #59: Problem starting ods-signer on a 64-bit machine
* ods-ksmutil: update zonelist command now correctly adds and deletes zones (and
  sorts out their keys).

OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b8 - 2009-11-23

* ods-ksmutil: KSK rollover now holds at the point where the new key is made
  active until the command "ds-seen" is issued.
* ods-ksmutil: "database backup" implemented to safely make a copy of the
  SQLite enforcer database.

Bugfixes:
* Auditor: Crashed on unknown RR class.
* Signer Engine: NSEC3 RR included wrong information in bitmap (fixed in ldns
  trunk).
* Signer Engine: Force a new signed zone if input is reread. Necessary because
  we cannot recognize if
  glue or unsigned delegations have been added and/or removed (yet).
* Signer Engine: Fix adding duplicate signatures in case of single key is
  being used as both ZSK and KSK.
* Bugreport #46: Vanishing records
* KASP Enforcer: Could not handle zones with names longer than 30 characters.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b7 - 2009-11-16

* ods-auditor: Dnsruby version 1.40 or later required.

* The supported RRs are documented on the wiki

Bugfixes:
* ods-ksmutil: Segmentation fault when missing arguments to "key import"
* KASP Enforcer: Improved support for MySQL (experimental)
* Signer Engine: DLV is included in NSEC RR (fixed in LDNS 1.6.2)
* Signer Engine: Better handling of removed zones
* Signer Engine: Correct handling of zero length rdata - RFC3597 style (fixed
  in LDNS trunk)
* Signer Engine: Inherit class of zone to DNSSEC-related RRs


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b6 - 2009-11-06

  repository.

Bugfixes:

* Signer Engine: Fixed NSAP, IPSECKEY, and SIG parsing (in LDNS trunk).
* Signer Engine: Disable multiline parsing when the line is commented out.
* Signer Engine: The tools are not hanging any more. Better pipe handling.
* Signer Engine: NSEC zone even if only 1 NSEC is needed.
* Signer Engine: Don't create NSEC3 records for empty non terminals that
  lead to glue.
* Signer Engine: LDNS can now parse explicit TTLs that are non-numbers
  (for example 3d2h, in LDNS trunk).
* Bugreport #43: ods-signer: The command parser was too strict with white
  spaces.

OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b4 - 2009-10-23

* Default TTL in case of $TTL or explicit RR TTL becomes the SOA Minimum
  value (was 3600).
* The signer engine will check if another engine is already running before
  starting.
* Startup scripts for Solaris (SMF).
* Auditor gives an error if key moves to "in use" without sufficient
  "prepublished" time.

Bugfixes:
* Trailing spaces are not part of the domain name/ include file/ ttl in
  directives.
* nsec3er: Print final RRset, even if no NSEC3 was needed at that RRset.
* Proper privileges dropping when creating the command socket
* Signer sometimes didn't terminate if socket shutdown failed.

Known issues:
* The Signer Engine fails with broken pipes sometimes.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b3 - 2009-10-16

* Allow for SOA Serial/TTL/Minimum values of zero.
* Correct socket binding of NotifyListen.
* Systems with older SQLite had problem rolling keys on a policy.
* Auditor now handles SSHFP and NAPTR records correctly
  (but needs Dnsruby 1.39)
* Auditor now handles TTLs in zone file with suffix s, m, h, d, and w.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b2 - 2009-10-09

* Added experimental support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to KASP auditor.
  Dnsruby version 1.38 or higher required for SHA2 support.
* Added experimental support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to KASP enforcer
  and the signer engine.
* SignerThreads and KeygenInterval has been deprecated (actually removed
  just before 1.0.0b1).
* Added support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to libhsm. No API changes.

Bugfixes:
* Bugreport #33 (#35): Output a signed zone if only the SOA record changed. 
* Zone fetcher did not start correctly
* Create the pid / socket directory if it not yet exists, with the correct
  privileges.
* Signer Engine now catches exception if running with incorrect permission.
* TCP-support for LDNS on Solaris is fixed in LDNS trunk.

Known issues:
* LDNS is having problem with SRV records. The main effect is that these
  records are given non-valid RRSIGs. This is still under investigation.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b1 - 2009-10-02

* <Purge> tag added to automatically delete keys that have been dead
  for some interval.
* Rename all OpenDNSSEC command line tools and daemons to ods-XXX (e.g.
  ksmutil becomes ods-ksmutil).
* kasp_check command added to check the conf.xml and kasp.xml configuration
  files for sanity and consistency.
* communicated and keygend combined to form "ods-enforcerd".
* ksmutil command line changes. Most commands have changed slightly, but
  there are some significant changes (see
  http://svn.opendnssec.org/docs/command-tools-syntax.txt for details.)
* Enforcer database now has a version number. If it differs from the version
  number in the code (specified via a #define statement), the software will
  issue an error message and not connect to the database.
* "ksmutil list keys" now displays the keytag if the -l flag is passed to it.
* "Emergency Keys" renamed to "Standby Keys" as this better reflects their
  role in OpenDNSSEC.
* The behaviour of SOA Serial value 'counter' has changed according to
  Ticket #31.
* The directory "xml" and been renamed to "conf". (This is part of repository
  clean.)
* There are changes to the KASP DB:
* Zone fetcher added, that will do AXFR from the master.

  If want to use your old database, use the following commands to upgrade:

    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_090922_1.sqlite3
    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_090930_1.sqlite3
    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_091002_1.sqlite3

  Or, to start a new (with loss of information), remove old keys from the HSM
  and issue the command:

    ksmutil setup

Bugfixes:
* Make sure that parenthesis in zonefiles don't concatenate rdata fields.

Known issues:
* TCP-support for LDNS on Solaris is currently broken due to an issue with
  SO_RCVTIMEO. The result is that the zonefetcher doesn't work. No other
  parts of OpenDNSSEC is affected by this bug.
  There is currently no workaround.
