Repeated Values
---------------
A protobuf field that is declared as 'repeated' may contain zero or more values.

 
Required Values
--------------- 
A protobuf field that contains a single value can be either be declared as 
required or optional. This maps nicely to the SQL concept of nullable values.
So either a field has a value or it doesn't. When it does have a value that
should be of the type defined for the field.

 
Default Values
-------------
Both protobuf message field declarations and SQL Column declarations support
the notion of a default value. There is a subtle difference between the two
implementations though when the column is optional
