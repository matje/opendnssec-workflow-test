- Adding NSEC when not signing
- Different signature validity for non-denial and denial
- Make SignerThreads and WorkerThreads configurable
- Don't add NSEC3PARAM when not adding NSEC3 records
- Zone is updated, even if only the SOA serial changed
- Resigning can fail on certain changes [Bug #46?]
- Serial==keep
- Proper handling of SIGTERM
- Signer Auditor Communication
- No warning if socket file creation failed
- Usage
- Error if sign command has no arguments
- Changes to the zonelist will not be noted
- Verify output of ods-signer zones
- Missing /var/run/opendnssec/ directory after reboot
- ods-signer --help is missing options
- Give signer engine is not running error
- Do an auditor check
- Link (static) against libhsm
- Sign the tld all.
- Drop privileges
- Audit the temporary file
- clear <zone> errors on missing files
- Signer Engine not starting properly
- SHA-1
- SHA-2
- GOST
- Handle file permission errors (unix socket)
- No more Denial TTL
- Create pid directory if not exists
- Don't leave socket file under root permissions
- Missing check for XPath in configure.ac
- LDNS NSEC bitmap issues
- LDNS RR Parsing issues
- Allow for a SOA minimum and TTL of 0
- No hardcoded TTLs please
- Clear out whitespace after directives
- Do not start if already running
- Make sure to output a new zone if data has changed (not only signatures)
- Multiline parsing issues
- DS treated as out-of-zone data
- Signer to use all DNSKEY algorithms to sign RRsets
- DLV not in NSEC
- Zone removed but still in queue
- Signer produces empty zone
- Unknown RRs with rdlen=0 problem
- Signer inserts (null) into signed zone
- RRSIG and other DNSSEC RRs does not inherit class
- Serial number from internal data, not from signed output file
- Threaded RRset Signer
- Efficient handling of multiple zones
