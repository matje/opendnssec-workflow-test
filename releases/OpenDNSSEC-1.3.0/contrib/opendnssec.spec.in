%description
OpenDNSSEC was created as an open-source turn-key solution for DNSSEC. 
It secures zone data just before it is published in an authoritative 
name server.  OpenDNSSEC takes in unsigned zones, adds the signatures 
and other records for DNSSEC and passes it on to the authoritative name 
servers for that zone. DNS is complicated, and so is digital signing; 
their combination in DNSSEC is of course complex as well. The idea of 
OpenDNSSEC is to handle such difficulties, to relieve the administrator 
of them after a one-time effort for setting it up.  The storage of keys 
is done through a PKCS #11 standard interface. To deploy OpenDNSSEC, an 
implementation of this interface is needed, for example a software 
library, an HSM or perhaps a simpler token.
